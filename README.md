Certainly. Here's the revised, more concise description of the script:

This Bash script automates the compression of PDF files in the current directory. It's designed to reduce the file size of PDFs that exceed a specified size, helping to save storage space while maintaining file quality.

The script uses a size threshold to determine which files to compress. Any PDF larger than this threshold will be processed using Ghostscript, a powerful tool for PDF manipulation. The threshold concept allows users to focus on compressing only the larger files that are more likely to benefit from size reduction.

Usage:
1. Save the script as `compress_pdfs.sh` and make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x compress_pdfs.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   - With default settings (200KB threshold):
     ```bash
     ./compress_pdfs.sh
     ```
   - Or specify a custom threshold (e.g., 500KB):
     ```bash
     ./compress_pdfs.sh -t 500
     ```

The script provides progress output during operation and preserves original files if compression doesn't reduce size.

Note: Ghostscript must be installed on the system for the script to function.


Both the script and README, as one may guess), were generated by AI. Namely, by [claude](claude.ai).
